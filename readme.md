# License
This game was done in very little time for a gamejam, so don't expect the code to be too great.

- __Code__: All the source code is open source under the MIT license, so do whatever you want with it. Redistribute it, modify it, create a new game... I don't know, feel free to do whatever you want.
- __Sprites__: Also feel free to use the assets of the game, it would be cool if you credit me if you use them, but it's not mandatory.
- __Music__: I didn't make the music of this game. The music is made by Frederic Lardon, from his album Cellphone under CC0 so it's public domain. [Link to the album](https://loyaltyfreakmusic.com/music/cellphone/).
